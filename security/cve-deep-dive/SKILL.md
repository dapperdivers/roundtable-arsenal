# CVE Deep Dive

Comprehensive vulnerability analysis for specific CVEs. Goes beyond basic NVD data to provide actionable intelligence.

## Workflow

1. **Identify** — Parse CVE ID from task
2. **Query NVD** — Get base CVSS, description, affected products (CPE)
3. **Check OpenCTI** — Cross-reference with platform data for relationships
4. **Research** — Search for exploit PoCs, advisories, vendor patches
5. **Extract IOCs** — Pull indicators from references and advisories
6. **Assess** — Determine real-world risk considering exploit availability and exposure
7. **Report** — Generate structured analysis using template

## Analysis Template

Use [assets/cve-analysis.md](assets/cve-analysis.md) for output formatting.

## Scripts

### Query NVD API
```bash
bash scripts/query-nvd.sh CVE-2026-XXXXX
```

## Key Data Points to Extract

- **CVSS v3.1 score and vector** — base, temporal, environmental
- **Affected products** — CPE strings, version ranges
- **Exploit availability** — PoC on GitHub/ExploitDB, in-the-wild status
- **CISA KEV status** — is it in the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog?
- **EPSS score** — probability of exploitation
- **Patch status** — vendor advisory links, fixed versions
- **MITRE ATT&CK mapping** — relevant techniques
- **IOCs** — IPs, domains, hashes associated with exploitation
