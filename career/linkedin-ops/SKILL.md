# LinkedIn Operations

Guidelines for LinkedIn content creation, profile optimization, and professional networking.

## Post Writing Framework

### Structure: Hook → Value → CTA

**Hook (Line 1-2):** Stop the scroll. Must be compelling enough to click "see more."
- Start with a bold statement, surprising stat, or contrarian take
- Use line breaks after the hook for visual separation
- Avoid clickbait — deliver on the promise

**Value (Body):** The substance. Teach, share, or tell a story.
- Use short paragraphs (1-3 sentences)
- Include line breaks between paragraphs
- Use bullet points or numbered lists for scanability
- Personal stories outperform generic advice
- Specific > vague (numbers, names, details)

**CTA (Last line):** Drive engagement.
- Ask a question ("What's your take?")
- Invite sharing ("Repost if this resonates")
- Offer something ("DM me for the template")

### Post Templates

```

#### Career Update
```

[Brief context — 2-3 sentences]

```

### Content Rules
- **Frequency:** 2-3 posts per week maximum
- **Timing:** Tue-Thu 8-10am or 12-1pm (audience timezone)
- **Length:** 150-300 words (long enough for value, short enough to read)
- **Hashtags:** 3-5 relevant ones, placed at the end
- **Engagement:** Reply to every comment within 24 hours
- **No:** Humblebrags, engagement bait, "agree?" posts, political hot takes

## Notes
- Authenticity wins over polish — be real, not corporate
- LinkedIn is a long game — consistency matters more than virality
- Save top-performing posts as templates for future content
- Draft posts in a doc first; don't compose directly on LinkedIn
